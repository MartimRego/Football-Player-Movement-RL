The videos are visual representations of some of the models developed in this thesis. 

Hierarchical, KNN, Kmedoids and RBF use four different clustering algorithms aiming to assign each player in the defensive team to one of 3 pressure clusters (Goalkeepers are excluded)

PCM contains a visualization of the Pitch Control Model created (based on W. Spearman, “Beyond expected goals,” in MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, 2018.) with trained parameters.

Finally, DMIMGradientExtended contains a visualization of the final defensive movement model. The average DMIM (Defensive Movement Impact Metric) score is averaged over the last second and represented by a black to green gradient.
