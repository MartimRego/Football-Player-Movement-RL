This GitHub contains work for my thesis titled "Evaluating player off-the-ball movement in football with reinforcement learning". To perform this work I had access to full tracking data for 9 youth games (x and y positions for each of the 22 players at 10 frames per second) and some player touch data. 

**The code in this work was not written with the intent of convenience for those looking to emulate the same work, as such object oriented programming is rarely used and strong assumptions on the format of the data may be performed.**
